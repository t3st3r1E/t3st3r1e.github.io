Well This is my first blog for my own created blog site. My main motto for this 
is to keep myself busy on learning all the IT stuffs that come up to me. This is my static website and  with the help of Jekyll package of Ruby language I am being able to create this site within a short period of time. Moreover, I will help all of my visitors or my friends to share my overall experience on learning activities. If you have any suggestion or queries that you want to share, then you can easily contact me on several social platform which is also present on this site too.
Soon I will come up with some new post. Keep learning and keep sharing :D.
